## Working Doc

Here is where is where I will have working notes and preliminary code.  

As the project progresses, I will move the working code into dedicated scripts and delete the working notes (ex: planning, to-do's and resources) that have been implemented.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

mental_health <- read_csv("../data/mental_health.csv")

glimpse(mental_health)
mental_health_reduced <- mental_health %>% filter(UNIT %in% c("Number of persons","Percent"), Ref_Date == 2012)

mental_health_reduced %>% filter(GEO != "Canada")

glimpse(mental_health_reduced)
mental_health_reduced
# Age Levels
mental_health_reduced$AGE %>% factor() %>% levels()
# 
mental_health_reduced$HRPROF %>% factor() %>% levels()

mental_health_reduced %>% filter(HRPROF == "Perceived mental health, fair or poor") %>% filter(UNIT == "Percent") %>% filter(AGE == "15 to 24 years")


```
