## Working Doc

Here is where is where I will have working notes and preliminary code. 

Think of this as a notepad -- it's not really meant for outside eyes as it's just a place for me to get my thoughts and dirty code down. Read on if you dare.  

As the project progresses, I will move the working code into dedicated scripts and delete the working notes (ex: planning, to-do's and resources) that have been implemented.

```



Ideas:
- Render all of Canada shaded in different colours, checking either 1) Perceived Mental Health 2) Perceived Need for Mental Health 3) Self-Rated Stress
- Within each Province Click - 
  - Input Controls: 1) Gender 2) Age Included 3) Percentage vs. Count
  - Render - Percentage Suicidal (as NUMBER)
  - Render - Percentage Mental Health Services Accessed
  - Render - Mood Disorders bar chart (maybe include others -- PTSD, Schizophrenia?)  
  - Render - Substance Use bar Chart
- For all can toggle PERCENTAGE vs. COUNT



## From Class + Tutorials 

Tutorial from 545: http://stat545.com/shiny00_index.html


Go through the tutorials: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/  

note: reactive vs. eventreactive -- if want to it update on click of a button do eventreactive

in server.R -- can use renderUI to automatically generate checkboxes (her example, giving all the country names)

plotOutput -- use the click argument or hover, etc. 



Use this for colouring of Maps: http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=OrRd&n=4

## Leaflets Tutorial: 

https://www.r-bloggers.com/4-tricks-for-working-with-r-leaflet-and-shiny
---- "Code | Trick2 | Graph depends on click"  --  this will be really useful for SAVING what's highlighted as a reactive varaible for use in a graph


Highlight Options -- https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shapes.html  (Can highlight a Province)  --- this is from hover, need to modify it so that it's on click.
