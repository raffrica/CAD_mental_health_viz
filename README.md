## Overview
One in five Canadians experiences a mental health illness every year resulting in a cost of over $50 billion dollars to the Canadian economy. While it is clear that there are many broad sweeping changes that need to be implemented from schools to employment, it is difficult to really grasp the magnitude and shape of the problem – who experiences what mental health challenges and where do they experience it. My app will use aggregate data to unpack people’s perceptions on their own mental health and allow users to explore which mental health challenges are experienced between different age groups, genders and provinces. 


I am visualizing the public data from Stats Canada on the Open Government License entitled: Mental Health Profile, Canadian Community Health Survey – Mental Health (CCHS), by age group and sex, Canada and provinces - [link](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/bb9cc768-e2d5-4e1c-87dc-4ab6a38196b9)
